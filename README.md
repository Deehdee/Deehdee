This project is going to document the requirements, procedures, and progress for developing a PID controller for two servos.

At a simple level PID controllers are controllers that compare an input and an output to produce an error rate. Then by multiplying established "gains" by a proportional, integrative, and derivative calculation of the calculated error rate, the PID controller can reduce the error rate and make the necessary corrections to come to a steady state zero.
